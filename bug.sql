The SQL query uses a function that is not deterministic in a context where a deterministic function is required. For example, using the RAND() function in a WHERE clause can lead to unpredictable results.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = RAND();
```

This query will return different rows each time it is executed.  It's usually not what is intended.  Similar issues can arise with other non-deterministic functions or those that depend on implicit session state.
