To fix this issue, ensure you only use deterministic functions in places where consistent results are expected.  If randomness is needed, it should be handled separately. For example, use a deterministic column for filtering and generate random data after the data is selected. If you intend to select random rows, use appropriate techniques like ORDER BY RAND() or LIMIT with an offset generated randomly. 

Here's how to correct the query, depending on your intent:

**To select a single random row:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1;
```

**To select a random sample of rows:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 10;
```

**To select rows based on a deterministic condition:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 123; 
```

This ensures the query always returns the same rows given the same input.
